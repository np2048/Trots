# GnuPG â€” List available keys

    $ gpg --list-keys

In the current version it doesn't show **KEY_ID**. To get the id of a key enter in edit mode and you'll see KEY_ID of each key in the list:

    $ gpg --edit-key USER_EMAIL

Below the Hello message you'll find the list of the keys including KEY_ID:
