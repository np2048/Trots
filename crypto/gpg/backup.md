# How to backup and restore gpg keys

You can create a backup just by copying the whole *~/.gnupg* directory. But this is not safe and it is not a recommend way to backup the keys as it may lead to some bugs.

Or just export the secret keys:

    $ gpg --export-secret-keys > secret-backup.gpg

You only need the secret keys as they are used to decrypt data. But you can export public keys to. To generate an ASCII version of a user's public key to file *public.key* (e.g. to distribute it by e-mail):

    $ gpg --export --armor --output public.key user-id


Later you can restore keys using the *--import* option:

    $ gpg --import secret-backup.gpg
