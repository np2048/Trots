# SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) allows to securely connect to other machines in an unsecure network.

To enable SSH you have to install an SSH server. Some popular SSH servers:

- [OpenSSH](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenSSH) — Premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol
- [Dropbear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbear_(software)) — Lightweight SSH server. The command-line ssh client is named *dbclient*
- [lsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsh) — GNU SSH implementation
- [TinySSH](https://tinyssh.org/) — a minimalistic SSH server which implements only a subset of SSHv2 features.
