# How to SSH into an Android device

To be able to connect to an Android device via SSH you have to install and run SSH server on the device. There are several ways to do so:

1. You can use [SimpleSSHD](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.galexander.sshd/) as a lightweight and simple solution.
2. You can install [Termux](termux.md) and [configure OpenSSH in it](termux.md#ssh).
