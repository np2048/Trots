# The best open source GUI Git client for Linux

The best free and open source git client at this moment is [GitAhead](https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/).

# Installation

## Download the distro from the official website:

    https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/

Or from the release page:

    https://github.com/gitahead/gitahead/releases

Save the installation shell script (for now it is **GitAhead-2.6.3.sh**) and open the same path in the terminal.


## Move the installation script to your local software directory

Let's say you want to store the app at **~/opt/GitAhead** path:

    $ mkdir ~/opt
    $ mv GitAhead-2.6.3.sh ~/opt

## Run the installation script

Add execution permissions to the downloaded script and run:

    $ cd ~/opt
    $ chmod a+x GitAhead-2.6.3.sh
    $ ./GitAhead-2.6.3.sh
    
    By default GitAhead will be installed in:
      "/home/USERNAME/opt/GitAhead"
    Do you want to include the subdirectory GitAhead?
    Saying no will install in: "/home/USERNAME/opt" [Yn]:

Confirm the installation path:
    
    Y
## Launch the application
    
    $ ~/opt/GitAhead/GitAhead

## Alternatives

If you don't like GitAhead you can choose another GUI client:
